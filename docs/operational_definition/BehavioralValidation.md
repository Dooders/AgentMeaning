# Behavioral Validation Framework

This document outlines the methodologies and metrics for validating meaning preservation through behavioral and functional equivalence testing.

## Core Premise

A fundamental tenet of our operational definition is that the preservation of meaning should manifest in the preservation of behavior. If an agent with a transformed state behaves indistinguishably from its original state, we can consider the meaning to be preserved, regardless of structural differences in the representation.

## Behavioral Equivalence Metrics

### 1. Action Selection Agreement

**Definition**: The degree to which agents using original versus transformed states select the same actions in identical situations.

**Measurement**:
- Apply the same policy function to both original and transformed states
- Compare action selections across a diverse set of scenarios
- Calculate agreement rate: $Agreement = \frac{Matching\ Actions}{Total\ Actions}$

**Implementation**:
```python
def action_selection_agreement(original_states, transformed_states, policy_function):
    """Measure action selection agreement between original and transformed states."""
    original_actions = [policy_function(state) for state in original_states]
    transformed_actions = [policy_function(state) for state in transformed_states]
    
    matches = sum(1 for o, t in zip(original_actions, transformed_actions) if o == t)
    return matches / len(original_actions)
```

**Threshold**: An agreement rate of ≥ 0.90 is considered evidence of preserved meaning.

### 2. Temporal Behavior Trajectories

**Definition**: The similarity of behavior sequences over time when using original versus transformed states.

**Measurement**:
- Generate action sequences using original and transformed states
- Compute trajectory similarity using dynamic time warping or sequence alignment
- Calculate similarity score normalized to [0,1]

**Implementation**:
```python
def trajectory_similarity(original_trajectory, transformed_trajectory):
    """Measure similarity between behavior trajectories."""
    # Dynamic time warping or sequence alignment algorithm
    dtw_distance = compute_dtw(original_trajectory, transformed_trajectory)
    max_distance = max(len(original_trajectory), len(transformed_trajectory))
    
    # Normalize to [0,1] where 1 is perfect similarity
    similarity = 1 - (dtw_distance / max_distance)
    return similarity
```

**Threshold**: A trajectory similarity of ≥ 0.85 indicates preserved behavioral meaning.

### 3. Decision Time Consistency

**Definition**: The preservation of decision-making speed across transformations, as measured by inference time.

**Measurement**:
- Measure time required for decision-making with original and transformed states
- Calculate ratio of decision times
- Determine if transformed states maintain reasonable decision efficiency

**Implementation**:
```python
def decision_time_ratio(original_states, transformed_states, policy_function):
    """Measure the ratio of decision times between original and transformed states."""
    original_times = []
    transformed_times = []
    
    for o_state, t_state in zip(original_states, transformed_states):
        start = time.time()
        policy_function(o_state)
        original_times.append(time.time() - start)
        
        start = time.time()
        policy_function(t_state)
        transformed_times.append(time.time() - start)
    
    return sum(transformed_times) / sum(original_times)
```

**Threshold**: A ratio between 0.75 and 1.25 indicates preserved temporal meaning.

### 4. Task Completion Success

**Definition**: The degree to which agents using transformed states can successfully complete the same tasks as those using original states.

**Measurement**:
- Define a set of benchmark tasks
- Measure success rates using original and transformed states
- Calculate relative task performance

**Implementation**:
```python
def task_completion_ratio(original_states, transformed_states, task_evaluator):
    """Measure task completion success ratio between original and transformed states."""
    original_success = task_evaluator.evaluate(original_states)
    transformed_success = task_evaluator.evaluate(transformed_states)
    
    return transformed_success / original_success
```

**Threshold**: A task completion ratio of ≥ 0.95 indicates preserved functional meaning.

## Correlation Analysis Framework

To establish the relationship between semantic metrics and behavioral outcomes, we perform comprehensive correlation analysis:

### 1. Feature-Behavior Correlation

**Methodology**:
1. Vary preservation levels of specific features (spatial, resource, performance, role)
2. Measure behavioral outcomes for each variation
3. Calculate correlation coefficients between feature preservation and behavioral metrics

**Example Analysis**:
```python
def feature_behavior_correlation(feature_preservation_levels, behavior_metrics):
    """Calculate correlation between feature preservation and behavior metrics."""
    correlations = {}
    
    for feature in feature_groups:
        for behavior_metric in behavior_metrics:
            correlation = pearson_correlation(
                feature_preservation_levels[feature],
                behavior_metrics[behavior_metric]
            )
            correlations[f"{feature}_{behavior_metric}"] = correlation
    
    return correlations
```

**Visualizations**:
- Scatter plots of feature preservation vs. behavior metrics
- Heat maps of correlation strengths across feature-behavior pairs

### 2. Threshold Identification

**Methodology**:
1. Systematically vary transformation parameters to generate states with different preservation levels
2. Identify "cliff edges" where behavioral performance sharply declines
3. Establish minimum preservation thresholds for maintaining behavior

**Implementation**:
```python
def find_preservation_thresholds(preservation_levels, behavior_scores, threshold=0.90):
    """Find the preservation level threshold where behavior maintains >90% of original."""
    thresholds = {}
    
    for behavior_metric in behavior_scores:
        # Normalize behavior scores relative to maximum
        normalized_scores = behavior_scores[behavior_metric] / max(behavior_scores[behavior_metric])
        
        # Find first preservation level where behavior drops below threshold
        for i, score in enumerate(normalized_scores):
            if score < threshold:
                thresholds[behavior_metric] = preservation_levels[i-1]
                break
    
    return thresholds
```

### 3. Causal Intervention Testing

**Methodology**:
1. Perform targeted perturbations to specific features in the transformed state
2. Measure the impact on behavioral outcomes
3. Quantify the causal relationship between feature changes and behavior changes

**Implementation**:
```python
def causal_intervention_test(states, feature, perturbation_magnitudes, policy_function):
    """Test causal relationship between feature and behavior through intervention."""
    baseline_actions = [policy_function(state) for state in states]
    
    results = []
    for magnitude in perturbation_magnitudes:
        # Create perturbed states
        perturbed_states = [perturb_feature(state, feature, magnitude) for state in states]
        perturbed_actions = [policy_function(state) for state in perturbed_states]
        
        # Calculate action change rate
        change_rate = sum(1 for b, p in zip(baseline_actions, perturbed_actions) if b != p) / len(states)
        results.append((magnitude, change_rate))
    
    return results
```

## Cross-Context Validation

To ensure that our meaning preservation is robust across different environments and contexts:

### 1. Multi-Environment Testing

**Methodology**:
1. Test transformed states in multiple different environments/scenarios
2. Measure behavioral consistency across contexts
3. Identify context-dependent aspects of meaning preservation

### 2. Role-Based Validation

**Methodology**:
1. Test meaning preservation for agents with different roles/functions
2. Identify role-specific requirements for meaning preservation
3. Refine importance weights based on agent role

### 3. Team/System-Level Validation

**Methodology**:
1. Extend validation from individual agents to multi-agent teams
2. Measure preservation of team-level behaviors and interactions
3. Validate meaning preservation in collaborative and competitive contexts

## Integration with Semantic Metrics

To complete the operational definition validation, we correlate behavioral metrics with semantic metrics:

### 1. Correlation Analysis

**Implementation**:
```python
def semantic_behavioral_correlation(semantic_metrics, behavioral_metrics):
    """Calculate correlation between semantic metrics and behavioral metrics."""
    correlations = {}
    
    for semantic_metric in semantic_metrics:
        for behavioral_metric in behavioral_metrics:
            correlation = pearson_correlation(
                semantic_metrics[semantic_metric],
                behavioral_metrics[behavioral_metric]
            )
            correlations[f"{semantic_metric}_{behavioral_metric}"] = correlation
    
    return correlations
```

### 2. Predictive Modeling

**Methodology**:
1. Build regression models to predict behavioral outcomes from semantic metrics
2. Evaluate prediction accuracy
3. Identify which semantic metrics best predict behavioral preservation

**Implementation**:
```python
def build_behavior_prediction_model(semantic_metrics, behavioral_outcomes):
    """Build model to predict behavioral outcomes from semantic metrics."""
    X = np.array(list(semantic_metrics.values())).T
    y = np.array(behavioral_outcomes)
    
    # Split data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
    
    # Train regression model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Evaluate
    r2 = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    feature_importance = {feature: importance for feature, importance 
                          in zip(semantic_metrics.keys(), model.coef_)}
    
    return model, r2, feature_importance
```

## Validation Experimental Protocol

### Experiment 1: Feature Importance Validation

**Methodology**:
1. Create transformed states with varying levels of preservation for each feature group
2. Measure behavioral outcomes for each transformation

**Methodology**:
1. Generate states at each preservation threshold level
2. Measure behavioral performance at each level
3. Verify behavioral performance aligns with qualitative categories

**Expected Results**: Behavioral performance should show similar categorical boundaries.

### Experiment 3: Comprehensive Correlation Analysis
