# Operational Definition of Meaning in Agent States

## Core Definition

**Meaning** in the context of agent states refers to the essential semantic content that determines an agent's identity, capabilities, and potential behaviors within its environment. It is operationally defined as:

> The minimal set of relational properties and state variables that, when preserved across transformations, maintains the agent's functional equivalence, behavioral potential, and identity within its environment.

This definition has three key components:

1. **Relational properties**: How the agent relates to its environment and other agents
2. **Behavioral potential**: What actions the agent is capable of or likely to take
3. **Identity preservation**: The recognizability of the agent as the same entity across transformations

## Formal Characterization

Mathematically, we define meaning preservation as a weighted multi-dimensional measurement:

Let $S$ be an agent state, and $T(S)$ be a transformation of that state.
Let $F = \{f_1, f_2, ..., f_n\}$ be a set of semantic feature extractors.
Let $W = \{w_1, w_2, ..., w_n\}$ be importance weights for each feature.

Meaning is preserved if:

$$M(S, T(S)) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot sim(f_i(S), f_i(T(S))) \geq \theta$$

Where:
- $sim$ is an appropriate similarity function for the feature type
- $\theta$ is a threshold for acceptable preservation
- $w_i$ are derived from empirical feature importance analysis

## Multi-dimensional Nature of Meaning

Meaning in agent states is not a monolithic concept but exists across multiple dimensions:

### 1. Positional/Spatial Meaning (55.4% importance)
- **Definition**: The agent's physical relationship to its environment
- **Key properties**: Position, velocity, orientation
- **Validation method**: Preservation of relative distances, trajectories, and spatial relationships

### 2. Resource Meaning (25.1% importance)
- **Definition**: The agent's internal state related to survival and capabilities
- **Key properties**: Health, energy, inventory
- **Validation method**: Preservation of resource levels and relative priorities

### 3. Performance Meaning (10.5% importance)
- **Definition**: The agent's functional status and capabilities
- **Key properties**: Is_alive, has_target, threatened
- **Validation method**: Binary accuracy and classification consistency

### 4. Role/Identity Meaning (5.0% importance)
- **Definition**: The agent's type, function, or role in the system
- **Key properties**: Agent role, class, specialization
- **Validation method**: Categorical accuracy and role consistency

## Philosophical Foundations

This operational definition is grounded in several philosophical traditions:

### Embodied Cognition
The high importance of spatial features (55.4%) aligns with theories of embodied cognition, which posit that meaning is fundamentally grounded in physical experience and spatial relationships.

### Functionalism
Our definition embraces a functionalist view that meaning is preserved when functional equivalence is maintained, even if the underlying structure changes.

### Relevance Realization
Following John Vervaeke's work, we recognize that meaning emerges from the process of determining what is relevant in a complex state space, which is reflected in our weighted importance approach.

### Affordance Theory
Drawing from James Gibson's work, we define meaning partially through the affordances (action possibilities) that an agent state enables, which is captured in our behavioral potential component.

## Validation Framework

The validation of meaning preservation requires a multi-faceted approach:

### 1. Structural Validation
- Cluster analysis in latent space
- Trajectory preservation
- Correlation matrix comparison

### 2. Behavioral Validation
- Functional equivalence testing
- Decision time consistency
- Policy network agreement

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Validation
- Expert panel evaluation
- Comparative reconstruction assessment
- Behavioral prediction accuracy

### 4. Correlation Validation
- Correlation between semantic metrics and behavioral outcomes
- Causal intervention testing (perturb features and measure impact)
- Cross-context validation (testing meaning preservation across environments)

## Operational Measurement

To operationalize this definition in practical terms, we measure:

### 1. Feature-Specific Preservation
For each feature group (spatial, resource, performance, role), we compute:
- Appropriate error metrics (RMSE, BCE, accuracy)
- Normalized similarity scores
- Weighted importance-based aggregation

### 2. Behavioral Equivalence
- Same policy applied to original and transformed states
- Measure agreement in action selection
- Compare outcome distributions

### 3. Integrated Score
Combining all measurements into a single "meaning preservation score":

$$MPS = \alpha \cdot P_{overall} + \beta \cdot B_{equiv} + \gamma \cdot H_{consensus}$$

Where:
- $P_{overall}$ is the overall feature preservation score
- $B_{equiv}$ is the behavioral equivalence score
- $H_{consensus}$ is the human consensus score
- $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are weighting parameters

## Thresholds for Meaning Preservation

Based on empirical validation and theoretical considerations, we establish the following thresholds:

| Category | Preservation Score | Interpretation |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Excellent | ≥ 0.95 | Practically indistinguishable in meaning |
| Good | ≥ 0.90 | Minor meaning variations that don't affect core functions |
| Acceptable | ≥ 0.85 | Some meaning differences but core identity preserved |
| Poor | ≥ 0.70 | Significant meaning loss affecting functionality |
| Critical | < 0.70 | Essential meaning and identity compromised |

These thresholds are derived from both empirical testing and theoretical considerations about what constitutes meaningful change in agent behavior.
