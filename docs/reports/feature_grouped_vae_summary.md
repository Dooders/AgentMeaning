# Feature-Grouped VAE Experiment: Summary

## Experiment Overview
We implemented a Feature-Grouped Variative Autoencoder that applies different compression rates to distinct feature groups based on their importance to meaning preservation.

## Experimental Setup
- **Input Dimension**: 15 features across 4 feature groups
- **Latent Dimension**: 32 (distributed non-uniformly)
- **Training Data**: 43,304 agent states
- **Validation Data**: 10,826 agent states
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Batch Size**: 64

## Compression Strategy
Each feature group received a custom compression rate aligned with its semantic importance:
- **Spatial** (features 0-3): 0.5x compression (expansion)
- **Resources** (features 3-5): 2.0x compression
- **Performance** (features 5-7): 3.0x compression
- **Status** (features 7-15): 5.0x compression

## Results

### Compression Effectiveness
| Feature Group | Features | Latent Dim | Effective Dim | Compression | MSE |
|---------------|----------|------------|---------------|-------------|-----|
| Spatial       | 3        | 6          | 12            | 0.5x        | 2613.48 |
| Resources     | 2        | 4          | 2             | 2.0x        | 4871.45 |
| Performance   | 2        | 4          | 1             | 3.0x        | 4882.83 |
| Status        | 8        | 17         | 3             | 5.67x       | 0.21 |
| **Overall**   | **15**   | **31**     | **18**        | **1.78x**   | **1823.38** |

### Key Findings
1. **Differential Compression Works**: The model successfully applied varying compression rates to different feature groups while maintaining overall representation.

2. **Spatial Expansion**: The spatial features required expansion rather than compression (0.5x rate) to preserve meaning, supporting the feature importance analysis that ranked spatial features highest (55.44%).

3. **Status Reconstruction Excellence**: Despite aggressive compression (5.67x), status features achieved near-perfect reconstruction (MSE 0.21), suggesting these features are highly compressible.

4. **Resource and Performance Challenges**: These mid-importance features showed the highest reconstruction errors despite moderate compression, indicating a complex relationship between importance and compressibility.

## Implications
The Feature-Grouped VAE demonstrates that meaning-preserving compression can be optimized by allocating representational capacity according to feature importance. Spatial features benefit from expanded representation, while status features can be heavily compressed without significant information loss. This aligns with our feature importance analysis and suggests that embodied positioning forms the core of agent meaning.

## Next Steps
1. **Fine-tune Group Compression Rates**: Adjust compression rates to better balance reconstruction quality across feature groups.
2. **Integrate Semantic Loss**: Add explicit semantic preservation objectives beyond pure reconstruction.
3. **Test Downstream Performance**: Evaluate how this compression scheme affects agent behavior prediction and simulation.
