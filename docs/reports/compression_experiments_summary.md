## Results

### Compression Performance

| Compression | Val Loss | Semantic Drift | Model Size (KB) |
|-------------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0.5 | 82021.25 | 4.49 | 422.72 |
| 1.0 | 207354.93 | 6.92 | 422.72 |

### Semantic Drift Analysis

The semantic drift metrics provide insights into how well semantic properties are preserved at different compression levels:

- Lowest semantic drift (4.49) was observed at compression level 0.5
- Highest semantic drift (10.85) was observed at compression level 5.0
- Clear trend showing increasing semantic drift with higher compression levels

## Interpretation

This compression experiment provides several key insights:

1. **Compression vs. Semantic Preservation**: There is a direct relationship between compression level and meaning loss, with lower compression levels better preserving semantic meaning.

2. **Validation Loss**: Validation loss increases substantially with higher compression levels, from ~82K at 0.5 to ~599K at 5.0, indicating degraded reconstruction quality.

3. **Model Size**: Interestingly, model size remained constant (422.72KB) across all compression levels, suggesting that the compression parameter affects internal information density rather than the actual model footprint in this implementation.

4. **Optimal Setting**: The optimal compression level appears to be 0.5, providing the best balance between information density and meaning retention.

## Limitations

1. **Limited Compression Range**: We tested compression levels from 0.5 to 5.0, but even lower levels might yield better semantic preservation.

2. **Constant Model Size**: The experiment didn't achieve reduced model size with increased compression, possibly due to implementation details or fixed architecture constraints.

3. **Missing Component-Level Analysis**: The metrics don't break down semantic drift by specific features (e.g., position, health, role) to identify which semantic properties are most affected by compression.

## Next Steps

Based on the results of this compression experiment, we propose the following next steps:

1. **Explore Lower Compression**: Test compression levels below 0.5 to see if semantic preservation can be further improved.

2. **Component-Level Analysis**: Analyze how different compression levels affect specific semantic properties.

3. **Alternative Compression Techniques**: Explore different compression methods beyond the entropy bottleneck approach.

4. **Architecture Modifications**: Investigate model architecture changes that might allow compression to affect model size while preserving meaning.

5. **Drift Threshold Tuning**: Refine the drift threshold (currently 0.1) based on observations from these experiments.

## Conclusion

Our compression experiments demonstrate that lower compression levels (0.5) provide significantly better semantic preservation than higher levels (5.0). The clear relationship between compression level and semantic drift suggests that applications requiring high semantic fidelity should use minimal compression. Notably, model size remained constant across compression levels, indicating that our current implementation affects information density rather than storage requirements.
