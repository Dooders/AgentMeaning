# Feature-Weighted Loss Implementation: Experiment Summary

## Experiment Overview

We implemented and evaluated a feature-weighted loss function designed to prioritize critical semantic properties during training of our Meaning-Preserving Transformation system. This implementation addresses Step 17 of our project plan, creating loss functions that give greater weight to features identified as most important through previous feature importance analysis.

## Implementation Details

### FeatureWeightedLoss Class Architecture
- **Base Class**: Extended `CombinedLoss` to maintain compatibility with existing architecture
- **Core Components**:
  - Feature-specific weighting based on importance scores
  - Progressive weight adjustment during training
  - Feature stability tracking and adaptive weight adjustment
  - Canonical weights derived from prior feature importance analysis
  
### Progressive Weight Scheduling
- **Supported Schedules**:
  - Linear: Gradual linear transition from initial to target weights
  - Exponential: Faster initial changes that taper off
- **Epoch-Based Adjustment**: Weights evolve automatically over training epochs
  
### Stability-Based Adjustment
- **Feature Stability Tracking**: Monitors variance in feature-specific losses
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Dynamically adjusts weights to compensate for unstable features
- **Stability Metric**: Inverse coefficient of variation, capped for stability

### Canonical Importance Weights
| Feature      | Canonical Weight |

## Interpretation

Our feature-weighted loss implementation and experiments revealed several key insights:

1. **Compression-Dependent Performance**: Feature-weighted loss showed positive impact at lower compression levels (0.5, 1.0) but degraded at higher compression levels (2.0, 5.0). This suggests the approach is more suitable for preservation than extreme compression.

2. **Binary Feature Preservation**: Binary features (has_target, role, threatened) were perfectly preserved across all experiments with both loss functions, indicating these representations are inherently robust.

3. **Spatial Feature Challenge**: Position features were poorly preserved regardless of loss function, suggesting structural limitations in the base architecture rather than in the loss function.

4. **Unexpected Degradation**: The is_alive feature showed significant degradation with feature-weighted loss despite its medium importance weight, suggesting potential interactions between features or training dynamics that require further investigation.

5. **Overall Semantic Similarity**: The weighted loss showed decreased overall semantic similarity in some experiments, contrary to expectation. This indicates the need for refinement in how weights are applied and balanced.

6. **Loss Reduction Success**: Despite semantic similarity challenges, the feature-weighted loss successfully reduced overall loss at lower compression levels, demonstrating its potential value with further optimization.

## Limitations

1. **Feature Interaction Effects**: Our implementation treats features independently, potentially missing important interactions between semantic properties.

2. **Training Time Sensitivity**: The progressive weight adjustment creates a dependency on number of epochs, which may need to be standardized across experiments.

3. **Discrete Features Bias**: The implementation may favor discrete/binary features over continuous ones, as discrete features appear easier to preserve regardless of weighting.

4. **Position Feature Challenge**: The poor preservation of position features, despite high importance weights, suggests architectural limitations beyond what the loss function can address.

5. **Stability Metric Refinement**: The current stability adjustment mechanism may need refinement to better capture meaningful versus noisy variations.

## Next Steps

Based on our findings, we recommend:

1. **Feature Interaction Modeling**: Develop loss components that capture relationships between features rather than treating them independently.

2. **Architecture Specialization**: Combine feature-weighted loss with architectural components specifically designed for high-importance features, particularly spatial positioning.

3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Conduct systematic tuning of stability thresholds, progressive scheduling parameters, and weight blending factors.

4. **Specialized Position Encoding**: Implement geometric or topological constraints in latent space specifically for position features, as suggested in Step 19 of the project plan.

5. **Gradient Analysis**: Analyze gradient flows through the network to understand why some features respond better to weighting than others.

6. **Feature-Type Specific Weighting**: Develop different weighting strategies for continuous versus discrete features based on their different preservation characteristics.

## Conclusion

The feature-weighted loss implementation successfully addresses Step 17 of our project plan, demonstrating the technical feasibility of prioritizing critical semantic properties during training. The approach shows promise, particularly at lower compression levels, but reveals complexities in semantic preservation that warrant further investigation. 

The challenges with position feature preservation emphasize the importance of Step 19 (Spatial Feature Optimization) in our project plan, while the variable impact across compression levels highlights the significance of Step 30 (Fine-Grained Compression Testing). Overall, this implementation lays essential groundwork for more sophisticated meaning-preserving transformations by establishing a framework for feature-specific optimization.
