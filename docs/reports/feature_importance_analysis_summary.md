# Feature Importance Analysis: Experiment Summary

## Experiment Overview

We conducted feature importance analysis on our Meaning-Preserving Transformation system to determine which aspects of agent state representations contribute most significantly to meaning preservation, using permutation importance methodology across five feature groups.

## Experimental Setup

### Model Configuration
- **Input Dimension**: 15
- **Latent Dimension**: 64
- **Hidden Dimensions**: [256, 128, 64] (encoder), [64, 128, 256] (decoder)
- **Compression Type**: Entropy bottleneck
- **Compression Level**: 1.0
- **Feature Groups Analyzed**: Spatial, Resource, Status, Performance, Role

### Analysis Configuration
- **Permutation Iterations**: 10
- **Evaluation Metric**: Combined score of reconstruction loss and semantic drift
- **Test Dataset**: 15% of total dataset (separate from training data)

## Results

### Feature Importance Ranking

| Feature Group | Relative Importance (%) | Raw Importance | Stability Score (0-1) |
|---------------|------------------------:|---------------:|----------------------:|
| Spatial       | 55.44 | 0.352 | 0.406 |
| Resource      | 25.11 | 0.160 | 0.394 |
| Performance   | 10.55 | 0.067 | 0.499 |
| Status        | 4.73  | 0.030 | 0.000 |
| Role          | 4.17  | 0.027 | 0.000 |

### Feature Group Composition
- **Spatial**: Position coordinates (x, y, z) - indices [0, 1, 2]
- **Resource**: Health, energy, resource_level - indices [3, 4, 5]
- **Status**: Current health, is_defending, age - indices [6, 7, 8]
- **Performance**: Total reward - index [9]
- **Role**: One-hot encoding of agent roles - indices [10-14]

## Interpretation

The feature importance analysis revealed several key insights:

1. **Spatial Dominance**: Position data accounts for over half (55.4%) of the total importance, indicating location is fundamental to agent identity and behavior.

2. **Resource Significance**: Resource-related attributes contribute a quarter of total importance (25.1%), suggesting these physiological metrics are essential to agent meaning.

3. **Performance Contribution**: Performance metrics show moderate importance (10.5%) with the highest stability score (0.499), indicating consistent relevance across permutations.

4. **Role and Status Subordination**: Role and status features contribute minimally to meaning preservation (< 5% each) with low stability, suggesting these are more contextual than fundamental.

5. **Stability Hierarchy**: Performance features showed the most consistent importance across iterations, while status and role features demonstrated high variability.

## Limitations

1. **Feature Group Granularity**: The analysis grouped features rather than examining individual feature importance, potentially obscuring nuanced contributions.

2. **Permutation Iterations**: Ten iterations provided useful insights but may not be sufficient for fully stable metrics, particularly for lower importance features.

3. **Context Dependency**: The importance rankings may vary in different simulation contexts or environments.

4. **Model Dependency**: Results reflect importance through the lens of the specific VAE architecture used.

## Next Steps

Based on our findings, we recommend:

1. **Adaptive Compression Strategy**: Develop compression strategies that preserve spatial and resource features with higher fidelity while compressing role and status features more aggressively.

2. **Fine-grained Feature Analysis**: Decompose feature groups further to understand importance at the individual feature level.

3. **Cross-Context Validation**: Test if feature importance rankings remain consistent across different simulation contexts and environments.

4. **Architecture Optimization**: Redesign encoder/decoder architecture to give special attention to high-importance features.

5. **Integration with Hyperparameter Tuning**: Combine these findings with hyperparameter tuning experiments to develop feature-weighted loss functions.

## Conclusion

Our feature importance analysis identifies spatial positioning as the cornerstone of agent meaning preservation, followed by resource states. This aligns with embodiment theories suggesting that physical presence fundamentally shapes identity. The clear importance hierarchy offers a roadmap for optimizing our meaning-preserving transformation system through feature-oriented architectural design and adaptive compression strategies, potentially enabling more efficient models that retain the most semantically important aspects of agent states.
