# **Visualizations**

## **1. System Overview Diagrams**

### **1.1 System Architecture (Conceptual Diagram)**
**Purpose:** Introduce the core components and their interactions.

- An abstract diagram showing:
  - **Serializer**
  - **Encoder**
  - **Latent space**
  - **Compression module**
  - **Decoder**
  - **Loss function**

**Tip:** Make this diagram artistic but informative—it sets the tone.

---

### **1.2 Transformation Pipeline Flowchart**
**Purpose:** Show the data transformations clearly, layer by layer.

```plaintext
Agent State (dict)
    ↓ serialization
Binary Representation
    ↓ encoder
Latent Space
    ↓ compression
Compressed Code
    ↑ decompression
Latent Space
    ↑ decoder
Reconstructed Binary
    ↑ deserialization
Reconstructed Agent State
```

- Optional: annotate each arrow with info (loss type, shape change, etc.)
- Include both direction of flow and feedback loop.

## **2. Compression vs Reconstruction Plots**

### **2.1 Latent Size vs Reconstruction Error**
**Purpose:** Show trade-off between compression and fidelity.

- X-axis: Latent dimensionality or bits used
- Y-axis: Reconstruction loss (MSE, BCE, etc.)
- Can add zlib baseline as a flat line for reference

---

### **2.2 Compression Ratio vs Semantic Loss**
**Purpose:** Reveal when meaning starts breaking under high compression.

- X-axis: Estimated bits per state
- Y-axis: Semantic deviation metric
  - e.g., behavior divergence, task reward drop, etc.

This shows where compression crosses the "meaning threshold."

## **3. Latent Space Visualizations**

### **3.1 t-SNE or PCA Embedding of Latent Codes**
**Purpose:** Explore how the model organizes meaning internally.

- Plot agent states in 2D based on latent space encoding
- Color or mark:
  - Similar semantic states
  - Different agent roles
  - Reconstructed vs original

This can visually prove the **clustering of meaning** in latent space.

---

### **3.2 Interpolation Between Latent Points**
**Purpose:** Show smooth transformation and continuity in latent space.

- Pick two semantically distinct states (A and B)
- Linearly interpolate their latent codes
- Decode and visualize the resulting reconstructed states

You'll be able to demonstrate how the system generalizes *between* known states—i.e., whether it understands *semantic blending.*

---

## **4. Qualitative Comparisons**

### **4.1 Original vs Reconstructed State Comparison**
**Purpose:** Let readers *see* what's preserved and what's not.

For each example:
- Original agent state (key features)
- Reconstructed version
- Differences highlighted
- Optional: downstream action taken by each

Show a few cases:
- High-fidelity match
- Subtle semantic divergence
- Total failure (for analysis)

---

### **4.2 Behavioral Replay or State Trajectories**
**Purpose:** Demonstrate that the reconstructed state behaves similarly.

- Run simulations using original and reconstructed states
- Plot agent paths or actions over time
- Overlay for direct comparison

This is especially good if you have agents that move in space or accumulate rewards.

---

## **5. System Learning Dynamics (Optional)**

### **5.1 Loss Curves Over Time**
- Plot total loss, reconstruction loss, KL loss separately
- Shows how the system balances compression vs fidelity over training

### **5.2 Latent Entropy vs Epoch**
- Show how the information content of the latent space evolves
- Does it become more efficient over time?
