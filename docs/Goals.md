# Research Goals

## 1. Academic Contribution
- Publish a paper emphasizing novel approach to meaning preservation during state transformation
- Develop robust meaning metrics and behavioral validation protocols
- Establish theoretical foundations for semantic equivalence across representational forms

## 2. Technical Artifacts
- Create a modular, reusable compression/representation library for agent simulations
- Develop visualization tools for tracking semantic drift across transformations
- Build evaluation frameworks that quantify meaning preservation beyond simple reconstruction metrics

## 3. Theoretical Framework
- Formalize principles of efficient semantic preservation in complex systems
- Connect information-theoretic compression to philosophical concepts of meaning
- Develop a taxonomy of transformational equivalence that bridges technical and conceptual domains

## 4. Applied Extensions
- Demonstrate practical applications in multi-agent simulations
- Show how meaning-preserving compression enables more efficient agent systems
- Create integration examples with existing agent frameworks

## 5. Research Methodology Innovation
- Develop novel evaluation methods for semantic preservation
- Create benchmarks for comparing different approaches to meaning retention
- Establish experimental protocols for measuring drift across representational layers
