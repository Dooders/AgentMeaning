# Counterfactual Meaning Testing: A Research Proposal

## Problem Statement
Current approaches to evaluating meaning preservation rely primarily on static metrics that compare original and reconstructed agent states directly. However, these methods fail to capture the dynamic, functional aspects of meaningâ€”how an agent would respond to different scenarios or how small perturbations might affect semantically important behaviors. Without probing how meaning holds up under counterfactual conditions, we lack a robust understanding of whether our preservation systems maintain the functional essence of agent states. We propose developing a counterfactual meaning testing framework that evaluates semantic preservation through systematic "what-if" exploration and behavioral invariance analysis.

## Proposed Approach

### 1. Counterfactual Scenario Generation
Develop systematic methods to:

- **Generate Meaningful Perturbations**: Create semantically relevant variations of agent states
- **Design Decision-Critical Scenarios**: Construct situations that test behavioral implications
- **Identify Semantic Boundaries**: Find the thresholds where meaning changes
- **Create Progressive Challenge Levels**: Build scenarios of increasing semantic complexity

### 2. Behavioral Invariance Testing
Implement frameworks to:
- Compare agent behaviors across original and reconstructed states in counterfactual scenarios
- Identify which aspects of behavior remain invariant under transformations
- Measure the sensitivity of semantic properties to different types of perturbations
- Quantify the robustness of meaning preservation in dynamic contexts

### 3. Counterfactual Explanation Generation
Create systems that:
- Explain why particular counterfactuals reveal semantic differences
- Identify which transformations preserve behavioral equivalence under counterfactuals
- Provide insights into the causal structure of meaning in agent states
- Generate diagnostic feedback for improving preservation systems
