# Hierarchical Meaning Representation: A Research Proposal

## Problem Statement
Current meaning preservation approaches typically operate at a single level of abstraction, treating all semantic elements with equal granularity. However, meaning naturally exists at multiple hierarchical levels—from low-level details to high-level concepts—with complex dependencies between these levels. Without the ability to represent and navigate this hierarchy, systems struggle to adapt compression to different semantic needs and fail to capture the multi-layered nature of meaning. We propose developing a hierarchical meaning representation framework that explicitly models semantic information at multiple levels of abstraction, enabling variable-resolution compression and more nuanced preservation of meaning.

## Proposed Approach

### 1. Multi-Resolution Semantic Encoding
Develop a representation framework that:

- **Explicitly Models Multiple Levels**: From fine-grained details to abstract concepts
- **Preserves Level-Appropriate Information**: Different compression at each level
- **Maintains Cross-Level Dependencies**: Captures how levels influence each other
- **Enables Targeted Access**: Retrieves information at specific abstraction levels

### 2. Adaptive Resolution Mechanisms
Implement systems that:
- Dynamically adjust the level of detail based on context and needs
- Provide variable compression rates for different semantic levels
- Allocate representational capacity based on semantic importance
- Adapt hierarchical structure based on the data and task

### 3. Hierarchical Navigation and Exploration
Create interfaces for:
- Moving between abstraction levels in compressed representations
- Drilling down into details when needed
- Zooming out to understand high-level patterns
- Visualizing relationships between hierarchical levels

### Integration with Existing System

The hierarchical meaning representation system integrates with the main meaning preservation framework through:

**Integration Points:**

3. **Resolution Control API**: Interface for dynamically adjusting detail levels during transformation
4. **Multi-Scale Evaluation**: Metrics for measuring preservation at each hierarchical level

**Data Flow:**
- Agent states are encoded into multi-level representations
- Resolution controller determines appropriate detail for the context
- Decoder reconstructs with level-appropriate detail
- Navigation interface allows exploration across the hierarchy
