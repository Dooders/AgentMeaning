# Explainable Meaning Transformation: A Research Proposal

## Problem Statement
Current meaning preservation systems operate largely as black boxes, with limited visibility into why certain semantic elements are preserved while others are lost during transformation. This opacity hinders user trust, makes it difficult to diagnose preservation failures, and limits the ability to fine-tune systems for specific semantic priorities. Without explainability, meaning preservation remains more art than science. We propose developing an explainable meaning transformation framework that makes the encoding, compression, and reconstruction processes transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human understanding of semantic importance.

## Proposed Approach

### 1. Multi-Level Explanation Generation
Develop mechanisms to:

- **Explain Feature Importance**: Clarify which agent features most influence preservation
- **Visualize Transformation Decisions**: Show how and why elements are encoded and reconstructed
- **Articulate Semantic Rationales**: Generate natural language explanations for semantic choices
- **Highlight Preservation Trade-offs**: Make explicit the compromises in different preservation strategies

### 2. Interactive Explanation Interfaces
Implement interfaces that:
- Allow users to explore different aspects of the transformation process
- Enable "what-if" exploration of alternative preservation strategies
- Provide contextual explanations at different levels of technical detail
- Incorporate user feedback to improve explanation relevance and quality

### 3. Explanation-Aware Training
Create training frameworks that:
- Optimize for both semantic preservation and explainability simultaneously
- Generate inherently more interpretable intermediate representations
- Include explanation quality in the evaluation metrics
- Incorporate human feedback on explanation utility
