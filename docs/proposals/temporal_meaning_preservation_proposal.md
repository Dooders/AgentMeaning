# Temporal Meaning Preservation: A Research Proposal

## Problem Statement
Current meaning preservation approaches focus almost exclusively on static agent states, treating each state as an isolated snapshot. However, meaning often emerges from patterns across time—causal relationships, narratives, intentions, and trajectories—that cannot be captured by examining states in isolation. Without preserving temporal relationships, we lose critical aspects of meaning related to how states evolve and influence each other. We propose developing a temporal meaning preservation framework that explicitly models, encodes, and preserves the semantic connections between agent states across time, maintaining narrative coherence and causal relationships.

## Proposed Approach

### 1. Temporal Semantic Modeling
Develop representations that:

- **Capture State Transitions**: Model how agent states evolve over time
- **Preserve Causal Relationships**: Maintain cause-effect links between states
- **Encode Narrative Structure**: Capture story arcs and meaningful sequences
- **Represent Intentions and Goals**: Model teleological aspects across time

### 2. Sequence-Aware Transformation
Implement systems that:
- Transform sequences of states while maintaining their relationships
- Compress temporal patterns more efficiently than state-by-state approaches
- Adaptively allocate representational capacity to semantically significant transitions
- Preserve different types of temporal dependencies (causal, narrative, intentional)

### 3. Temporal Coherence Evaluation
Create frameworks to:
- Measure preservation of semantic continuity across reconstructed sequences
- Evaluate causal relationship maintenance between states
- Assess narrative coherence in reconstructed trajectories
- Compare temporal patterns and rhythms between original and reconstructed sequences
