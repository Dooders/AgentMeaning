# Adversarial Meaning Robustness: A Research Proposal

## Problem Statement
Current meaning preservation systems are typically evaluated under idealized conditions with well-formed inputs. However, in real-world applications, these systems will face noisy, corrupted, or even adversarially manipulated agent states. Without explicit robustness to semantic attacks and perturbations, meaning preservation systems may catastrophically fail when faced with edge cases or deliberately crafted inputs. We propose developing an adversarial meaning robustness framework that systematically identifies semantic vulnerabilities, creates defenses against meaning distortion, and ensures reliable preservation even under challenging conditions.

## Proposed Approach

### 1. Semantic Vulnerability Assessment
Develop methods to:

- **Identify Semantic Attack Surfaces**: Discover where meaning preservation is most vulnerable
- **Generate Adversarial Perturbations**: Create minimal changes that maximally disrupt meaning
- **Categorize Vulnerability Types**: Classify different ways meaning can be compromised
- **Quantify Robustness Boundaries**: Map the limits of preservation reliability

### 2. Adversarial Defense Mechanisms
Implement techniques that:
- Detect and mitigate adversarial inputs before processing
- Strengthen preservation against different classes of semantic attacks
- Adapt dynamically to new or unforeseen perturbation types
- Maintain meaningful representation under noise and corruption

### 3. Robustness-Aware Training
Create training frameworks that:
- Incorporate adversarial examples into the learning process
- Optimize for semantic stability rather than just reconstruction accuracy
- Balance standard performance with robustness considerations
- Progressively challenge the system with increasingly sophisticated attacks
