# Interactive Meaning Negotiation System: A Research Proposal

## Problem Statement
Current meaning preservation systems rely on pre-defined, static definitions of what constitutes "meaningful" in agent states. However, meaning is inherently subjective, contextual, and often requires human interpretation to fully capture. Without a mechanism for humans to guide and refine what aspects of meaning should be preserved, systems may optimize for semantic properties that humans don't actually value while missing crucial elements that humans consider essential. We propose developing an interactive meaning negotiation system that enables collaborative definition and refinement of meaning between humans and AI, creating a shared understanding of semantic priorities.

## Proposed Approach

### 1. Human-AI Collaborative Meaning Definition
Create a framework for:

- **Semantic Priority Elicitation**: Methods to extract what humans consider meaningful
- **Disagreement Resolution**: Techniques to address conflicting definitions of meaning
- **Multi-Perspective Integration**: Combining different views of what constitutes meaning
- **Dynamic Refinement**: Evolving definitions based on ongoing interaction

### 2. Interactive Visualization and Feedback
Develop interfaces that:
- Display meaning representations in human-interpretable forms
- Allow direct manipulation of semantic priorities
- Visualize the impact of preservation choices on different meaning aspects
- Facilitate exploration of semantic spaces and relationships

### 3. Active Learning for Meaning Alignment
Implement a system that:
- Identifies areas of semantic uncertainty requiring human input
- Strategically selects examples to maximize learning from human feedback
- Generalizes from specific feedback to broader semantic principles
- Continuously improves alignment with human meaning concepts

### Integration with Existing System

The interactive meaning negotiation system integrates with the meaning preservation system through:

**Integration Points:**
1. **Preference-Weighted Loss Functions:** Human priorities directly influence optimization objectives
2. **Guided Latent Space Navigation:** Human feedback shapes the organization of the latent space
3. **Attention Mechanism Control:** Human input directs what the system attends to during encoding/decoding
4. **Evaluation Metric Customization:** Alignment with human priorities determines success metrics

**Data Flow:**
- Human feedback is formalized as preference models
- Preference models shape loss functions and attention weights
- Transformation results are visualized for human assessment
- Alignment metrics guide further interaction needs
