# Concept Index

This is an alphabetical index of all documented concepts related to the Meaning-Preserving Transformation System.

## A

## B

## C
- [Compression as Semantic Distillation](compression_as_semantic_distillation.md) - The process by which compression naturally separates signal from noise, forcing a system to prioritize semantically important information

## D

## E
- [Example Concept](example_concept.md) - Brief description of what this concept is about

## F

## G
- [Graph Neural Networks](graph_neural_networks.md) - Neural networks that operate on graph-structured data

## H

## I
- [Intuition as Learned, Reversible Mapping](intuition_as_learned_reversible_mapping.md) - The emergent capability of a system to efficiently translate between different representational forms while preserving essential meaning

## J

## K
- [Knowledge Representation](knowledge_representation.md) - Methods for symbolically encoding knowledge

## L
- [Latent Space](latent_space.md) - Compressed representation of data in an embedding space
- [Latent Space as Structured Essence](latent_space_as_structured_essence.md) - The conception that well-formed latent spaces capture the underlying semantic structure and relationships that give rise to data patterns

## M
- [Meaning as Invariance Through Transformation](meaning_as_invariance.md) - The principle that meaning is defined by what remains unchanged across different representational forms
- [Meaning Preservation](meaning_preservation.md) - The core project goal of maintaining semantic meaning across transformations

## N

## O

## P

## Q

## R

## S
- [Semantic Loss](semantic_loss.md) - Metrics for measuring loss of meaning during transformations

## T

## U
- [Understanding as Regenerative Compression](understanding_as_regenerative_compression.md) - The conception of understanding as the ability to distill information to its essence and then regenerate it with preserved meaning

## V
- [Variational Autoencoder](variational_autoencoder.md) - Neural network architecture for learning latent representations

## W

## X

## Y

## Z
