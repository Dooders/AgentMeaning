# Meaning Preservation

## Definition
Meaning Preservation refers to the ability of a system to maintain the essential semantic content and relational structure of information as it undergoes transformations across different representational forms. In our context, it's the core goal of ensuring that agent states retain their functional and semantic integrity throughout encoding, embedding, compression, and reconstruction processes.

## Key Properties
- **Fidelity**: The degree to which transformed information maintains the original meaning and intent
- **Invariance**: Preservation of the essential properties that define meaning, even as incidental details change
- **Relational Integrity**: Maintenance of meaningful connections between entities and attributes
- **Functional Equivalence**: Ability of reconstructed states to produce equivalent behaviors or responses

## Relationships
This concept relates to:
- [Semantic Loss](semantic_loss.md): Metrics for measuring the degradation of meaning during transformations
- [Knowledge Representation](knowledge_representation.md): The symbolic encoding that initially captures meaning
- [Latent Space](latent_space.md): The compressed representation where meaning must be preserved
- [Variational Autoencoder](variational_autoencoder.md): Architecture that enables compressed meaning representation

## Applications
In this project, the concept is applied in the following ways:
- Designing compression algorithms that prioritize semantic features over structural ones
- Creating metrics that track meaning retention across transformations
- Developing validation techniques that test whether meaning is preserved at the behavioral level
- Building graph structures that capture relational meaning beyond simple attribute values

## Questions
- How do we quantitatively measure meaning without reducing it to statistical properties?
- Is there a minimal set of properties that must be preserved to maintain meaning?
- How does context influence what aspects of meaning are most important to preserve?
- Can we develop a taxonomy of meaning types that helps guide preservation priorities?
