# Intuition as Learned, Reversible Mapping Across Modalities

## Definition
Intuition, in our framework, refers to the emergent capability of a system to efficiently translate between different representational forms while preserving essential meaning. It is the learned ability to map information across modalities (symbolic, latent, compressed) in a way that becomes increasingly accurate and efficient as the system identifies which features are most semantically significant.

## Key Properties
- **Bidirectionality**: Ability to move seamlessly between different representations in both directions
- **Adaptation**: Learning to prioritize semantically important features over time
- **Efficiency**: Reducing cognitive load through compressed yet meaningful translations
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring structures across seemingly different representations
- **Contextual Sensitivity**: Adjusting mapping strategies based on context and relevance

## Relationships
This concept relates to:
- [Meaning Preservation](meaning_preservation.md): The goal that intuitive mappings achieve across transformations
- [Latent Space](latent_space.md): The dimensionally-reduced representation where intuitive mappings operate
- [Compression as Semantic Distillation](compression_as_semantic_distillation.md): The process that forces intuitive systems to prioritize salient features
- [Meaning as Invariance](meaning_as_invariance.md): The philosophical foundation for what intuitive mappings preserve

## Applications
In this project, the concept is applied in the following ways:
- Training neural architectures to develop mappings that preserve agent behavior across representations
- Building translation mechanisms between symbolic states and latent embeddings
- Implementing systems that improve semantic fidelity through iterative learning
- Developing metrics that assess the "intuitiveness" of mappings based on semantic preservation
- Creating visualization tools that reveal how mapping capabilities evolve during training

## Questions
- How can we quantify the "intuitiveness" of a mapping beyond its accuracy?
- Can intuitive mappings be transferred across domains or must they be domain-specific?
- What is the relationship between compression efficiency and intuitive mapping quality?
- How does the development of intuitive mappings in our systems compare to human intuition formation?
- Can we design architectures that specifically optimize for intuitive mapping capacity?
