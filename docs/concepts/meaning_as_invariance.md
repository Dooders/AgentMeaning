# Meaning as Invariance Through Transformation

## Definition
`Meaning as Invariance Through Transformation` posits that the essential meaning of information is precisely what remains unchanged when that information undergoes various representational transformations. It suggests that semantic content is defined by the invariant properties that persist across different forms and encodings, rather than by the specific form of representation itself.

## Key Properties
- **Transformation Resilience**: True meaning persists despite changes in representational form
- **Form-Content Distinction**: Separates the vehicle of representation from what is being represented
- **Essence Identification**: Helps identify which properties constitute the core meaning vs. incidental details
- **Cross-Modal Consistency**: Meaning remains recognizable across different modalities and encodings

## Relationships
This concept relates to:
- [Meaning Preservation](meaning_preservation.md): The practical goal of maintaining semantic integrity across transformations
- [Latent Space](latent_space.md): Where compressed invariant properties are captured
- [Compression as Semantic Distillation](compression_as_semantic_distillation.md): The process that naturally highlights invariant properties
- [Understanding as Regenerative Compression](understanding_as_regenerative_compression.md): How meaning invariance enables reconstruction

## Applications
In this project, the concept is applied in the following ways:
- Designing transformations that deliberately vary incidental features while preserving essential ones
- Creating evaluation metrics that identify invariant properties across representational changes
- Training models to recognize and prioritize invariant features in latent space
- Developing taxonomies of transformation types and their effects on semantic properties

## Questions
- How can we systematically identify which properties should remain invariant for a given domain?
- Is there a hierarchy of invariance, where some properties are more fundamental to meaning than others?
- How does this concept relate to information-theoretic notions like mutual information?
- Can we design specific transformations that reveal particular aspects of meaning?
