# Steps for Implementation

1. **Initial Project Setup**
   - Create the project directory structure as outlined in Summary.md
   - Set up a virtual environment and install essential dependencies
   - Initialize git repository (if not already done)
   - Create a basic `requirements.txt` file

2. **Data Handling Implementation**
   - Implement `data.py` for agent state generation and serialization
   - Create synthetic agent states with semantic properties (position, health, energy, role, etc.)
   - Implement serialization/deserialization of agent states
   to binary format

3. **Core Model Architecture**
   - Implement VAE architecture in `model.py` with encoder and decoder components
   - Add compression mechanisms (entropy bottleneck or vector quantization)
   - Define the full pipeline: agent state → binary → latent → compressed → reconstructed

4. **Loss Functions**
   - Implement multiple loss components as described in Learning.md and SementicLoss.md:
     - Reconstruction loss
     - KL divergence/entropy loss
     - Semantic loss with the feature extractors

5. **Training Infrastructure**
   - Create training loop in `train.py`
   - Implement logging and checkpointing
   - Add semantic drift tracking

6. **Metrics and Evaluation**
   - Implement metrics.py for semantic feature extraction
   - Add functions to evaluate semantic equivalence between original and reconstructed states
   - Create drift tracking tools

7. **Visualization Tools**
   - Implement visualization modules for:
     - Latent space (t-SNE, PCA)
     - Loss curves and training dynamics
     - Comparison between original and reconstructed states
     - Semantic drift tracking

8. **First Experiment**
   - Run first training with minimal functionality
   - Test reconstruction quality
   - Analyze latent space structure

9. **Compression Experiments**
   - Run a series of experiments with varying compression levels (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0)
   - Analyze how different compression rates affect semantic preservation
   - Create visualization comparisons between compression levels
   - Identify optimal compression setting for balancing information density with meaning retention
   - Document findings in a compression analysis report
