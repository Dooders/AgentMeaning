# Steps for Implementation

1. **Initial Project Setup** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Create the project directory structure as outlined in Summary.md
   - Set up a virtual environment and install essential dependencies
   - Initialize git repository (if not already done)
   - Create a basic `requirements.txt` file

2. **Data Handling Implementation** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Implement `data.py` for agent state generation and serialization
   - Create synthetic agent states with semantic properties (position, health, energy, role, etc.)
   - Implement serialization/deserialization of agent states to binary format

3. **Core Model Architecture** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Implement VAE architecture in `model.py` with encoder and decoder components
   - Add compression mechanisms (entropy bottleneck or vector quantization)
   - Define the full pipeline: agent state → binary → latent → compressed → reconstructed

4. **Loss Functions** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Implement multiple loss components as described in Learning.md and SementicLoss.md:
     - Reconstruction loss
     - KL divergence/entropy loss
     - Semantic loss with the feature extractors

5. **Training Infrastructure** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Create training loop in `train.py`
   - Implement logging and checkpointing
   - Add semantic drift tracking

6. **Metrics and Evaluation** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Implement metrics.py for semantic feature extraction
   - Add functions to evaluate semantic equivalence between original and reconstructed states
   - Create drift tracking tools

7. **Visualization Tools** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Implement visualization modules for:
     - Latent space (t-SNE, PCA)
     - Loss curves and training dynamics
     - Comparison between original and reconstructed states
     - Semantic drift tracking

8. **First Experiment** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Run first training with minimal functionality
   - Test reconstruction quality
   - Analyze latent space structure

9. **Compression Experiments** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Run a series of experiments with varying compression levels (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0)
   - Analyze how different compression rates affect semantic preservation
   - Create visualization comparisons between compression levels
   - Identify optimal compression setting for balancing information density with meaning retention
   - Document findings in a compression analysis report

10. **Extended Training**
    - Increase the number of epochs significantly to allow the model to learn more robust representations
    - Use a larger dataset with real agent states to capture richer, more varied semantics

11. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
    - Experiment with different latent dimensions
    - Adjust loss weightings (especially for semantic loss) to see if you can reduce drift in continuous/categorical features
    - Explore different compression levels

12. **Feature Importance Analysis**
    - Investigate why certain features (e.g., energy, role) show moderate drift
    - Consider using ablation studies or attention analysis if using a transformer
    - Potentially adapt the loss function to give more weight to features that are critical for downstream agent behavior

13. **Visualization & Diagnostic Tools**
    - Create t-SNE/PCA visualizations of the latent space to see how agents cluster by role or other semantic attributes
    - Expand your drift logging and semantic audit tools to correlate drift with actual changes in agent behavior

14. **Downstream Behavioral Tests**
    - Integrate reconstructed states back into the simulation to see if the agents behave similarly to the original states
    - Use performance metrics (e.g., survival, task completion) as additional indicators of semantic preservation

15. **Ultra-Low Compression Testing**
    - Test compression levels below 0.5 (0.1, 0.25) to find potential further improvements in semantic preservation
    - Compare performance metrics across the expanded compression level range
    - Determine if there's a diminishing returns threshold for lowering compression

16. **Model Architecture Investigation**
    - Analyze why model size remains constant despite varying compression levels
    - Experiment with alternative architectures that might better adapt their size to compression levels
    - Research potential memory and storage optimization opportunities

17. **Feature-Specific Compression Analysis**
    - Run detailed analysis on how each semantic property responds to different compression levels
    - Identify which features are most sensitive to compression
    - Map the relationship between feature type (discrete, continuous, categorical) and compression sensitivity

18. **Dataset Scaling Test**
    - Increase dataset size significantly (10,000+ states) to test scalability
    - Measure impact of dataset size on semantic preservation across compression levels
    - Identify if larger datasets help mitigate semantic drift at higher compression

19. **Feature-Weighted Loss Implementation**
    - Develop and implement loss functions that prioritize critical semantic properties
    - Create tunable weights for different feature types based on their importance
    - Test if weighted loss can preserve meaning of specific features even at higher compression levels
