## Overview
This report documents the investigation into model architectures for meaning-preserving transformation system, focusing on:
1. Why model size remains constant despite varying compression levels
2. Effectiveness of adaptive architectures that adjust their size based on compression
3. Comparison of different architectures in terms of semantic preservation and model size

## Model Size Analysis

### Standard Architecture
In the standard architecture, the model size remains constant across different compression levels because:
- The compression level parameter only affects the loss calculation and bottleneck behavior
- It doesn't change the network structure or parameter count
- All model components (encoder, decoder, bottleneck) maintain the same dimensions

This means that while higher compression levels constrain the information flow through the bottleneck, they don't actually reduce the model's storage footprint or memory usage.

### Adaptive Architecture
The adaptive architecture modifies its structure based on compression level by:
- Dynamically adjusting the effective dimension of the bottleneck
- Using projection layers to map between the full latent space and the compressed space
- Maintaining the encoder and decoder dimensions for consistency

This results in fewer parameters at higher compression levels, particularly in the bottleneck component.

## Key Findings

1. **Standard Architecture Limitations**
   - Model size remains constant regardless of compression level
   - This leads to inefficient storage at higher compression levels
   - The model allocates resources to dimensions that are constrained by the compression

2. **Benefits of Adaptive Architecture**
   - Model size decreases with higher compression levels
   - This provides storage and memory efficiency aligned with compression goals
   - The parameter count more accurately reflects the model's information capacity

3. **Comparison of Architectures**
   - Standard architecture achieves slightly better semantic preservation at low compression
   - Adaptive architecture provides better efficiency at high compression levels
   - The adaptive approach offers better scalability across varying compression needs

## Recommendations

1. **Adopt Adaptive Architecture:**
   - Implement the adaptive architecture to achieve true parameter reduction with compression
   - This provides better alignment between model size and information capacity

2. **Feature-Specific Compression:**
   - Extend the adaptive approach to apply different compression levels to different feature groups
   - Prioritize high-importance features (spatial, resources) with lower compression
   - Apply higher compression to less critical features (role, status)

3. **Dynamic Compression:**
   - Develop mechanisms to dynamically adjust compression levels based on context
   - Allow the model to allocate more capacity to high-importance states or contexts

4. **Optimize Encoder/Decoder:**
   - Investigate potential optimizations to encoder/decoder architectures
   - Consider lightweight alternatives to standard fully-connected networks
   - Explore architectures that can better preserve spatial relationships

## Next Steps

1. Implement and test feature-specific compression strategy
2. Develop dynamic compression adjustment mechanisms
3. Benchmark optimized architectures on larger datasets
4. Integrate adaptive architecture into the main model pipeline
