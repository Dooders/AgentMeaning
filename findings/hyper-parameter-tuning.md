# Hyperparameter Tuning Experiment

### Assessment
- **Status**: Hyperparameter tuning experiments completed
- **Progress**: ðŸŸ¢ Good
- **Confidence**: ðŸŸ¢ High
- **Meaning Preservation**: ðŸŸ¢ High at optimal configuration, ðŸ”´ Low with suboptimal parameters

### Details
- Conducted comprehensive hyperparameter tuning across:
  - Latent dimensions: [16, 32, 64, 128]
  - Compression levels: [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]
  - Semantic loss weights: [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]
- Used 5000 real agent states from simulation database
- Trained each model for 30 epochs
- Discovered optimal configuration: 32D latent space, 1.0 compression, 2.0 semantic weight
- Achieved lowest semantic drift (1.35) with this configuration
- Validation loss for optimal configuration (3859) significantly better than suboptimal ones (24000-97000)
- Confirmed U-shaped performance curve for compression levels
- Model size varied with latent dimension but not with other parameters

### Top Questions
1. What is the exact relationship between latent dimension and semantic preservation?
2. Why does the 32D latent dimension outperform both smaller and larger dimensions with optimal parameters?
3. Is there an optimal ratio between input dimension and latent dimension for meaning preservation?
4. Would integrating semantic loss earlier in training provide better results than constant weighting?
5. How do the optimal hyperparameters change when scaling to much larger datasets?

### Answered Questions
1. **Is there an optimal latent space dimensionality for balancing compression and meaning?** - Yes, 32 dimensions provided the best balance of model size and semantic preservation.
2. **How do different hyperparameters interact in their effect on meaning preservation?** - Strong interactions observed between latent dimension, compression level, and semantic weight.
3. **What is the relationship between compression level and semantic drift with real data?** - Confirmed U-shaped relationship centered at compression level 1.0.
4. **What architectural changes might allow higher compression while maintaining semantic integrity?** - Higher semantic weights (2.0) significantly improve semantic integrity at compression level 1.0.

### Key Insights

#### Hyperparameter Interactions
- Strong interdependence between latent dimension, compression level, and semantic weight
- Optimal configuration (32D, 1.0 compression, 2.0 semantic weight) achieved 5.6x better semantic preservation than worst configuration
- At optimal compression (1.0), all latent dimensions performed reasonably well (drift 1.35-1.67)
- Away from optimal compression, larger latent dimensions became more beneficial

#### Compression Level Confirmation
- Previous finding confirmed: compression level 1.0 represents optimal "sweet spot"
- Consistent U-shaped performance curve across all latent dimensions and semantic weights
- At compression 1.0, semantic drift remained in 1.3-1.6 range across configurations
- At compression 0.5 or 2.0, semantic drift increased to 3.6-7.6 range

#### Semantic Weight Impact
- Higher semantic weights (especially 2.0) significantly improved meaning retention
- Most effective at the optimal compression level (1.0)
- Effect more pronounced with the optimal latent dimension (32)
- Demonstrates importance of properly balancing different loss components

#### Model Size Considerations
- Latent dimension significantly affects model size: 16D (402KB), 32D (424KB), 64D (485KB), 128D (679KB)
- Optimal configuration (32D) offers excellent performance with moderate model size
- No variation in model size with compression level or semantic weight changes
- For resource-constrained applications, 16D with optimal compression and semantic weight (1.66 drift) is viable

### Next Steps
- Fine-tune around the optimal values with smaller intervals (compression 0.8-1.2, semantic weights 1.5-2.5, latent dimensions 24-48)
- Implement adaptive semantic weight scheduling for potentially better results
- Test different encoder/decoder architectures with the optimal hyperparameters
- Analyze feature-specific preservation patterns with the optimal configuration
- Run extended training (100+ epochs) with optimal hyperparameters to determine performance ceiling
