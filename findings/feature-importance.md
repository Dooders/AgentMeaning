# Feature Importance Analysis Experiment

### Assessment
- **Status**: Feature importance analysis completed
- **Progress**: ðŸŸ¢ Good
- **Confidence**: ðŸŸ¢ High
- **Meaning Preservation**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium with current feature-agnostic approach

### Details
- Analyzed importance of five feature groups in agent state representations
- Used permutation importance method with 10 iterations per feature group
- Analyzed with a 64-dimensional latent space VAE and 1.0 compression level
- Features analyzed: Spatial (position), Resource (health/energy), Status, Performance, Role
- Used 5000 real agent states with 15% held out for testing
- Evaluated importance based on combined reconstruction loss and semantic drift
- Discovered clear hierarchy of feature importance with spatial features dominating

### Top Questions
1. How can we leverage feature importance findings to create an adaptive compression strategy?
2. Would importance scores change with different latent space dimensions or compression levels?
3. How do importance rankings vary across different simulation contexts or environments?
4. What is the relationship between feature importance and semantic drift at varying compression levels?
5. How might architectural modifications that prioritize spatial features affect overall meaning preservation?

### Key Insights

#### Feature Importance Hierarchy
- Spatial features (position coordinates) dominate importance (55.4%)
- Resource features (health, energy) show significant importance (25.1%)
- Performance metrics have moderate importance (10.5%)
- Status and role features contribute minimally (<5% each)
- Clear direction for optimization: prioritize spatial and resource preservation

#### Stability Analysis
- Performance features showed highest stability (0.499) across permutation iterations
- Spatial (0.406) and resource (0.394) features showed moderate stability
- Status and role features showed no stability (0.000), indicating high variability
- Higher stability correlates with consistent importance across different contexts

#### Philosophical Implications
- "Where an agent is" matters more than "what role it plays" for meaning preservation
- Physical location appears fundamental to agent identity and behavior
- Aligns with embodiment theories in cognitive science where physical presence shapes identity
- Suggests a spatial-first approach to agent state representation

#### Practical Applications
- Adaptive compression strategies should preserve spatial features with high fidelity
- Architecture could be optimized to give special attention to position and resource data
- Role and status features can be compressed more aggressively with minimal meaning loss
- Feature-weighted loss functions could improve overall meaning preservation

### Next Steps
1. Develop and test adaptive compression strategies that vary compression rates by feature group
2. Conduct fine-grained analysis of individual features within each group
3. Test feature importance across different simulation contexts to assess generalizability
4. Redesign encoder/decoder architecture to prioritize high-importance features
5. Integrate findings with hyperparameter tuning to develop feature-weighted loss functions
6. Explore the relationship between feature importance and the optimal 32D latent space identified in previous experiments
