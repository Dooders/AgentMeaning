# Initial Proof of Concept Experiment

### Assessment
- **Status**: Initial proof of concept completed
- **Progress**: 游리 Moderate
- **Confidence**: 游리 Medium
- **Meaning Preservation**: 游릭 High for discrete features, 游리 Medium for continuous features

### Details
- Single-epoch training with minimal synthetic dataset (32 states)
- Perfect preservation of some features (position, health, is_alive)
- Moderate drift in others (energy: 0.74, role: 0.70)
- Overall semantic drift of 0.36 (low to moderate)
- High reconstruction loss (68,171) as expected with minimal training
- Classification metrics better than regression metrics
- Computational efficiency good, no significant performance issues

### Top Questions
1. Why do discrete features show better preservation than continuous ones?
2. Is the high reconstruction loss primarily due to limited training or architectural limitations?
3. What is the relationship between latent space organization and semantic preservation?
4. How does the entropy bottleneck affect different semantic properties differently?
5. What is the optimal balance between reconstruction accuracy and semantic preservation?

### Next Steps
- Run compression experiments with varying levels (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0)
- Increase training duration to at least 20 epochs
- Generate visualization of latent space organization
- Test with larger synthetic dataset (1000+ states)
- Explore adjustments to loss weights to improve continuous feature preservation

## Key Insights

### Compression Thresholds
- Clear evidence that lower compression levels (0.5) preserve meaning significantly better than higher levels
- Semantic drift more than doubles from lowest to highest compression levels
- Validation loss increases by ~7x from lowest to highest compression
- Optimal balance between density and meaning appears to be at the lowest tested compression level

### Semantic Representation
- Binary/discrete properties appear easier to preserve than continuous ones
- Categorical features (like role) show moderate preservation difficulty
- Current model architecture may implicitly prioritize certain features

### Compression Dynamics
- Even at compression level 1.0, system maintains reasonable semantic preservation
- Classification properties (threatened: 100% accuracy) preserved better than regression properties
- Perfect semantic preservation may not require perfect reconstruction

### Questions for Further Investigation
1. What is the fundamental relationship between compression and meaning?
2. Can we identify a compression threshold beyond which semantic drift becomes unacceptable?
3. How do different compression mechanisms (entropy vs. VQ) affect meaning preservation?
4. Is there an optimal latent space dimensionality for balancing compression and meaning?
5. How can we better preserve hierarchical or relational semantic properties?
