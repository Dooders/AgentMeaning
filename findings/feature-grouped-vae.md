# Feature-Grouped VAE Experiment

### Assessment
- **Status**: Feature-grouped VAE experiment completed
- **Progress**: ðŸŸ¢ Good
- **Confidence**: ðŸŸ¢ High
- **Meaning Preservation**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium with varying success across feature groups

### Details
- Implemented a VAE with group-specific compression rates based on feature importance
- Applied different compression strategies to spatial, resource, performance, and status features
- Used 32-dimensional latent space distributed non-uniformly across feature groups
- Trained on 43,304 agent states with 10,826 for validation
- Ran for 50 epochs with batch size 64
- Achieved overall 1.78x compression while expanding spatial features

### Top Questions
1. Why do resource and performance features show high reconstruction errors despite moderate compression?
2. What explains the exceptional reconstruction quality of status features despite aggressive compression?
3. How does expansion rather than compression of spatial features affect downstream task performance?
4. What is the optimal balance between feature-specific compression rates for overall meaning preservation?
5. How would explicit semantic loss functions further improve group-specific compression strategies?

### Key Insights

#### Differential Compression Effectiveness
- Spatial features required expansion (0.5x compression) to preserve meaning
- Status features achieved near-perfect reconstruction (MSE 0.21) despite 5.67x compression
- Resource and performance features showed high MSE despite moderate compression
- Overall compression rate of 1.78x achieved while maintaining semantic relationships
- Different feature types benefit from radically different compression approaches

#### Feature Importance Correlation
- Results strongly validate previous feature importance analysis findings
- Spatial feature dominance (55.4% importance) confirmed by need for expansion
- Status features' low importance (<5%) validated by successful aggressive compression
- Clear relationship between feature importance and optimal compression strategy

#### Implementation Insights
- Effective dimensionality varies significantly from nominal latent dimensions
- Spatial features require 12 effective dimensions despite only having 3 input features
- Status features need only 3 effective dimensions for 8 input features
- Suggests intrinsic complexity of features not directly tied to their dimensionality

#### Architectural Implications
- Feature-grouped approach offers superior solution to uniform compression
- Group-specific encoders/decoders enable targeted representation learning
- Architecture can be further optimized based on feature complexity rather than raw dimensionality
- System benefits from knowledge of semantic importance in architectural design

### Next Steps
1. Fine-tune compression rates to improve resource and performance feature reconstruction
2. Add explicit semantic preservation loss functions to the current reconstruction objective
3. Test downstream performance on agent behavior prediction and simulation
4. Explore further expansion of spatial features to reduce high MSE
5. Investigate multi-stage compression approaches with progressive feature prioritization
6. Integrate with other meaning preservation techniques for a comprehensive solution
