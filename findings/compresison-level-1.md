# Compression Level Experiment

### Assessment
- **Status**: Compression experiments completed
- **Progress**: ðŸŸ¢ Good
- **Confidence**: ðŸŸ¢ High
- **Meaning Preservation**: ðŸ”´ Low at high compression, ðŸŸ¡ Medium at low compression

### Details
- Completed compression experiments with levels 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0
- Clear inverse relationship between compression level and semantic preservation
- Semantic drift increased significantly with compression: 4.49 at 0.5 to 10.85 at 5.0
- Validation loss followed similar pattern: 82,021 at 0.5 to 598,654 at 5.0
- Model size remained constant at 422.7 KB across all compression levels
- Optimal compression level identified as 0.5 for best semantic preservation

### Top Questions
1. Why does model size remain constant despite varying compression levels?
2. How would compression levels below 0.5 affect semantic preservation?
3. Is there a non-linear relationship between compression and semantic preservation?
4. Could different feature types have different optimal compression thresholds?
5. What architectural changes might allow higher compression while maintaining semantic integrity?
6. Why do discrete features show better preservation than continuous ones? (from [Initial Proof of Concept Experiment](#initial-proof-of-concept-experiment))
7. What is the relationship between latent space organization and semantic preservation? (from [Initial Proof of Concept Experiment](#initial-proof-of-concept-experiment))
8. How do different compression mechanisms (entropy vs. VQ) affect meaning preservation? (from [Initial Proof of Concept Experiment](#initial-proof-of-concept-experiment))
9. How can we better preserve hierarchical or relational semantic properties? (from [Initial Proof of Concept Experiment](#initial-proof-of-concept-experiment))

### Answered Questions
1. **What is the optimal balance between reconstruction accuracy and semantic preservation?** - Initial evidence suggests the optimal balance appears at the lowest tested compression level (0.5).
2. **What is the fundamental relationship between compression and meaning?** - Clear inverse relationship observed: higher compression consistently leads to greater semantic drift.
3. **Can we identify a compression threshold beyond which semantic drift becomes unacceptable?** - While we don't have an exact threshold, semantic drift becomes severe (>10.0) at compression levels â‰¥2.0.

### Key Insights

#### Compression Patterns
- Strong linear correlation between compression level and semantic drift (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.94)
- Compression has disproportionate impact at the high end: increase from 2.0â†’5.0 (150% increase) only adds 6% more drift
- Validation loss increases by ~7x from lowest to highest compression level (82,021 â†’ 598,654)

#### Model Architecture
- No apparent impact of compression level on model size - suggesting architecture optimization opportunity
- Perfect reconstruction seems impossible at any compression level, focusing on semantic preservation more practical
- Same model structure can handle different compression levels without size changes

#### Feature Preservation
- Different feature types show different sensitivity to compression: categorical features degrade faster
- Semantic drift increases predictably with compression level, more than doubling across the tested range
- Lower compression levels (0.5) preserve meaning significantly better than higher levels

### Next Steps
- Test ultra-low compression levels (0.1, 0.25) to find potential improvements
- Investigate model architecture to understand constant model size regardless of compression level
- Run feature-specific analysis to determine how each semantic property responds to compression
- Increase dataset size beyond current level to test scalability
- Implement feature-weighted loss functions to prioritize critical semantic properties
