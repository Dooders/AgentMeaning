**Subject:** A Meaning-Preserving Compression System Inspired by Your Work

Dear Dr. Vervaeke,

I hope this message finds you well. I’ve been deeply influenced by your lectures on *relevance realization* and the nature of cognitive meaning. Your work has helped crystallize several ideas I’ve been developing around systems that preserve and transform meaning across different layers of representation.

I’m currently working on a system that ingests structured agent state data from a real-time multi-agent simulation, and progressively transforms it—from structured form to binary encoding, through a latent space using a trained VAE, and back again. The goal is to maintain semantic integrity at each layer—what I think of as a **meaning-preserving transformation pipeline**. 

Rather than focusing on compression as pure efficiency, I’m exploring it as a form of *insight enactment*, preserving what’s relevant about an agent’s state as it moves through representational boundaries. Field definitions are embedded once, and these condition the system’s understanding during transformation. I'm training the system in tandem with the simulation, so it develops in a kind of participatory context—a notion I see echoed in your discussions of procedural and perspectival knowing.

Eventually, I hope to build a taxonomy of these transformations—one that models not just what is preserved, but how meaning *shifts* across frames while still staying intelligible. It’s an attempt, in a way, to encode relevance realization itself.

I won’t take more of your attention than necessary, but if any of this resonates, I’d be honored to share more or hear your thoughts. Whether or not you have the time, I want to thank you for the clarity and depth you bring to such foundational questions. Your work is a rare kind of signal.

Warm regards,  
Chris Mangum
