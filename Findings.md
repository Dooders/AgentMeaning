## Initial Proof of Concept Experiment

### Assessment
- **Status**: Initial proof of concept completed
- **Progress**: ðŸŸ¡ Moderate
- **Confidence**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium
- **Meaning Preservation**: ðŸŸ¢ High for discrete features, ðŸŸ¡ Medium for continuous features

### Details
- Single-epoch training with minimal synthetic dataset (32 states)
- Perfect preservation of some features (position, health, is_alive)
- Moderate drift in others (energy: 0.74, role: 0.70)
- Overall semantic drift of 0.36 (low to moderate)
- High reconstruction loss (68,171) as expected with minimal training
- Classification metrics better than regression metrics
- Computational efficiency good, no significant performance issues

### Top Questions

2. Is the high reconstruction loss primarily due to limited training or architectural limitations?
3. What is the relationship between latent space organization and semantic preservation?
4. How does the entropy bottleneck affect different semantic properties differently?
5. What is the optimal balance between reconstruction accuracy and semantic preservation?

### Next Steps

- Increase training duration to at least 20 epochs
- Generate visualization of latent space organization
- Test with larger synthetic dataset (1000+ states)
- Explore adjustments to loss weights to improve continuous feature preservation

## Key Insights

### Compression Thresholds

9. How can we better preserve hierarchical or relational semantic properties? (from [Initial Proof of Concept Experiment](#initial-proof-of-concept-experiment))

### Answered Questions
1. **What is the optimal balance between reconstruction accuracy and semantic preservation?** - Initial evidence suggests the optimal balance appears at the lowest tested compression level (0.5).
2. **What is the fundamental relationship between compression and meaning?** - Clear inverse relationship observed: higher compression consistently leads to greater semantic drift.
3. **Can we identify a compression threshold beyond which semantic drift becomes unacceptable?** - While we don't have an exact threshold, semantic drift becomes severe (>10.0) at compression levels â‰¥2.0.

### Key Insights

#### Compression Patterns
- Strong linear correlation between compression level and semantic drift (RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.94)
- Compression has disproportionate impact at the high end: increase from 2.0â†’5.0 (150% increase) only adds 6% more drift
- Validation loss increases by ~7x from lowest to highest compression level (82,021 â†’ 598,654)

#### Model Architecture
- No apparent impact of compression level on model size - suggesting architecture optimization opportunity
- Perfect reconstruction seems impossible at any compression level, focusing on semantic preservation more practical
- Same model structure can handle different compression levels without size changes

#### Feature Preservation
- Different feature types show different sensitivity to compression: categorical features degrade faster
- Semantic drift increases predictably with compression level, more than doubling across the tested range
- Lower compression levels (0.5) preserve meaning significantly better than higher levels

### Next Steps
- Test ultra-low compression levels (0.1, 0.25) to find potential improvements
- Investigate model architecture to understand constant model size regardless of compression level
- Run feature-specific analysis to determine how each semantic property responds to compression
- Increase dataset size beyond current level to test scalability
- Implement feature-weighted loss functions to prioritize critical semantic properties

### Key Insights

#### Hyperparameter Interactions
- Strong interdependence between latent dimension, compression level, and semantic weight
- Optimal configuration (32D, 1.0 compression, 2.0 semantic weight) achieved 5.6x better semantic preservation than worst configuration
- At optimal compression (1.0), all latent dimensions performed reasonably well (drift 1.35-1.67)
- Away from optimal compression, larger latent dimensions became more beneficial

#### Model Size Considerations
- Latent dimension significantly affects model size: 16D (402KB), 32D (424KB), 64D (485KB), 128D (679KB)
- Optimal configuration (32D) offers excellent performance with moderate model size
- No variation in model size with compression level or semantic weight changes
- For resource-constrained applications, 16D with optimal compression and semantic weight (1.66 drift) is viable

### Next Steps

## Feature Importance Analysis Experiment

### Assessment
- **Status**: Feature importance analysis completed
- **Progress**: ðŸŸ¢ Good
- **Confidence**: ðŸŸ¢ High
- **Meaning Preservation**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium with current feature-agnostic approach

### Details
- Analyzed importance of five feature groups in agent state representations
- Used permutation importance method with 10 iterations per feature group
- Analyzed with a 64-dimensional latent space VAE and 1.0 compression level
- Features analyzed: Spatial (position), Resource (health/energy), Status, Performance, Role
- Used 5000 real agent states with 15% held out for testing
- Evaluated importance based on combined reconstruction loss and semantic drift
- Discovered clear hierarchy of feature importance with spatial features dominating

### Top Questions
1. How can we leverage feature importance findings to create an adaptive compression strategy?
2. Would importance scores change with different latent space dimensions or compression levels?
3. How do importance rankings vary across different simulation contexts or environments?
4. What is the relationship between feature importance and semantic drift at varying compression levels?
5. How might architectural modifications that prioritize spatial features affect overall meaning preservation?

### Key Insights

#### Feature Importance Hierarchy
- Spatial features (position coordinates) dominate importance (55.4%)
- Resource features (health, energy) show significant importance (25.1%)
- Performance metrics have moderate importance (10.5%)
- Status and role features contribute minimally (<5% each)
- Clear direction for optimization: prioritize spatial and resource preservation

#### Stability Analysis
- Performance features showed highest stability (0.499) across permutation iterations
- Spatial (0.406) and resource (0.394) features showed moderate stability
- Status and role features showed no stability (0.000), indicating high variability
- Higher stability correlates with consistent importance across different contexts

#### Philosophical Implications
- "Where an agent is" matters more than "what role it plays" for meaning preservation
- Physical location appears fundamental to agent identity and behavior
- Aligns with embodiment theories in cognitive science where physical presence shapes identity
- Suggests a spatial-first approach to agent state representation

#### Practical Applications
- Adaptive compression strategies should preserve spatial features with high fidelity
- Architecture could be optimized to give special attention to position and resource data
- Role and status features can be compressed more aggressively with minimal meaning loss
- Feature-weighted loss functions could improve overall meaning preservation

### Next Steps

2. Conduct fine-grained analysis of individual features within each group
3. Test feature importance across different simulation contexts to assess generalizability
4. Redesign encoder/decoder architecture to prioritize high-importance features
5. Integrate findings with hyperparameter tuning to develop feature-weighted loss functions
6. Explore the relationship between feature importance and the optimal 32D latent space identified in previous experiments
